Basic Ubuntu Commands for Beginner
1. sudo
sudo (SuperUser DO) Linux command allows you to run programs or other commands with administrative privileges, just like “Run as administrator” in Windows. This is useful when, for example, you need to modify files in a directory that your user wouldn’t normally have access to.

2. apt-get
apt-get is the one of the most important Ubuntu commands every beginner must know. It is used to install, update, upgrade and remove any package. apt-get basically works on a database of available packages. Here is the list of different apt-get commands:


sudo apt-get update
apt-get update with super user privileges is the first command you need to run in any Linux system after a fresh install. This command updates the database and let your system know if there are newer packages available or not.

sudo apt-get upgrade
After updating the package database, next step is to to upgrade the installed packages. For upgrading all the packages with available updates you can use this command.

And if you like to upgrade a particular package, the you should tweak the above command a little:

sudo apt-get upgrade <package-name>. Replace the <package-name> with your desired package.

sudo apt-get install
If you know the name of the package, then you can easily install a program using this command:

sudo apt-get install <package-name>. Replace the <package-name> with your desired package.


If you are not sure about the package name, the you can type a few letters and press tab and it will suggest all the packages available with those letters. Thanks for auto-completion feature.

3. ls
ls (list) command lists all files and folders in your current working directory. You can also specify paths to other directories if you want to view their contents.

4. cd
cd (change director”) Linux command also known as chdir used to change the current working directory. It’s one of the most used basic Ubuntu commands. Using this command is easy, just type cd followed by the the folder name. You can use full paths to folders or simply the name of a folder within the directory you are currently working. Some common uses are:

cd /  – Takes you to the root directory.
cd .. – Takes you up one directory level.
cd –  – Takes you to the previous directory.
Here are some examples to how to use cd command in Ubuntu:

Example 1: cd home – open home folder in current directory.

Example 2: cd Linux\ Drive – open Linux Drive named folder in directory. Here you can see I use backslash because the folder name has spaces so for each space you use “backslash+space”. Like, if your folder name is “am a programmer” then the cd command will be, “cd am\ a\ programmer”.

5. pwd
pwd (print working directory) Ubuntu command displays the full pathname of the current working directory.

6. cp
cp (copy) Linux command allows you to copy a file. You should specify both the file you want to be copied and the location you want it copied to – for example, cp xyz /home/myfiles would copy the file “xyz” to the directory “/home/myfiles”.

7. mv
mv (move) command allows you to move files. You can also rename files by moving them to the directory they are currently in, but under a new name. The usage is the same as cp – for example mv xyz /home/myfiles would move the file “xyz” to the directory “/home/myfiles”.

8. rm
rm (remove) command removes the specified file.

rmdir (“remove directory”) – Removes an empty directory.
rm -r (“remove recursively”) – Removes a directory along with its content.
9. mkdir
mkdir (make directory) command allows you to create a new directory. You can specify where you want the directory created – if you do not do so, it will be created in your current working directory.

10. history
history command displays all of your previous commands up to the history limit.

11. df
df (display filesystem) command displays information about the disk space usage of all mounted filesystems.

12. du
du (directory usage) command displays the size of a directory and all of its subdirectories.
 
13. free
free – Displays the amount of free space available on the system.

14. uname -a
uname -a – Provides a wide range of basic information about the system.

15. top
top – Displays the processes using the most system resources at any given time. “q” can be used to exit.

16. man
man command displays a “manual page”. Manual pages are usually very detailed, and it’s recommended that you read the man pages for any command you are unfamiliar with. Some uses are :

man man – Provides information about the manual itself.
man intro – Displays a brief introduction to Linux commands.
17. info
Similar to man, but often provides more detailed or precise information.

18. <command name> -h or <command name> –help
This command is a third alternative to get help. While not as detailed as the info or man pages, this will provide a quick overview of the command and its uses.

Ubuntu Terminal Shortcuts:
To further ease up your skill, these Ubuntu Terminal keyboard shortcuts would help.

If a very wide number of commands are possible, it can output a list of all possible completions.











































This article explains how quickly you can learn to install, remove, update and search software packages using apt-get and apt-cache commands from the command line. This article provides some useful commands that will help you to handle package management in Debian/Ubuntu based systems.

APT-GET and APT-CACHE Commands
APT-GET and APT-CACHE Commands

What is apt-get?
The apt-get utility is a powerful and free package management command line program, that is used to work with Ubuntu’s APT (Advanced Packaging Tool) library to perform installation of new software packages, removing existing software packages, upgrading of existing software packages and even used to upgrading the entire operating system.

What is apt-cache?
The apt-cache command line tool is used for searching apt software package cache. In simple words, this tool is used to search software packages, collects information of packages and also used to search for what available packages are ready for installation on Debian or Ubuntu based systems.

APT-CACHE – 5 Useful Basic Commands




1. How Do I List All Available Packages?
To list all the available packages, type the following command.

$ apt-cache pkgnames

esseract-ocr-epo
pipenightdreams
mumudvb
tbb-examples
libsvm-java
libmrpt-hmtslam0.9
libboost-timer1.50-dev
kcm-touchpad
g++-4.5-multilib
...



2. How Do I Find Out Package Name and Description of Software?
To find out the package name and with it description before installing, use the ‘search‘ flag. Using “search” with apt-cache will display a list of matched packages with short description. Let’s say you would like to find out description of package ‘vsftpd‘, then command would be.

$ apt-cache search vsftpd

vsftpd - lightweight, efficient FTP server written for security
ccze - A robust, modular log coloriser
ftpd - File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server
yasat - simple stupid audit tool
To find and list down all the packages starting with ‘vsftpd‘, you could use the following command.

$ apt-cache pkgnames vsftpd

vsttpd


3. How Do I Check Package Information?
For example, if you would like to check information of package along with it short description say (version number, check sums, size, installed size, category etc). Use ‘show‘ sub command as shown below.

$ apt-cache show netcat

Package: netcat
